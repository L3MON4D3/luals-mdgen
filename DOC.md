# Cat

This project models a cat. The cat can meow and eat, without limit.

* My doc:
  * `Cat.meow(target, volume)`: Make the cat meow at something, in some volume.
  * `Cat.eat(amount, foodname)`: Make the cat eat something.
  * ```lua
    print("lel")
    ```
  * `Cat.enemies(opts): boolean, string[]`: Return a list of enemies of all cats.  
    The function returns the following values:
    * `has_enemies: boolean` Whether the cat has enemies.
    * `enemies: string[]` List of enemie's names.
  * lel lol  
    lul
    ```lua
    print("lel")
    ```

  ```lua
  print("lol")
  ```
